## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Project Description

The project consists of one webpage with a dynamically generated navigation bar and 5 sections with a title and a paragraph each that you can scroll to by clicking on the section name in the navigation bar.
